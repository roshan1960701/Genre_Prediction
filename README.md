This repository contains a machine learning project focusing on predicting movie genres for Netflix titles. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and applying classification algorithms.

## Project Overview

- Cleaned and preprocessed a Netflix movie dataset, removing null values and redundant columns.
- Explored the relationships and patterns within the data using visualizations like heatmaps and bar plots.
- Developed predictive models using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers to predict movie genres.
- Evaluated and compared model performance, achieving an accuracy.
