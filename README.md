## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the genre of movies using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploration, and the application of classification algorithms to predict movie genres.

## Getting Started

### Reading Raw Dataset from Gdrive
In this section, we read the raw dataset from Google Drive.

### Data Cleaning
We clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for analysis.

### Exporting Cleaned Dataset into Gdrive
After cleaning, the dataset is exported back to Google Drive for easy access.

## Data Exploration
Explore the cleaned dataset to gain insights into the movie data.

## Data Preparation
Prepare the data for machine learning by feature selection and engineering.

## Predicting Genre of the Movies

### Random Forest Classification
Apply the Random Forest classifier to predict movie genres.

### Gradient Boosting Classifier
Use the Gradient Boosting classifier for genre prediction.

## Visualization of Genre
Visualize the predicted genres to understand the distribution and patterns.
